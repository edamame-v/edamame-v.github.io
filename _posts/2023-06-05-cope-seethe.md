THE PROJECT!

So, have any ya'll heard of D&D?

I want to work on a D&D Engine.

No, this isn't like my [previous project](https://github.com/edamame-v/GMCampaignManager).

I mean, it is.

BUT IT'S DIFFERENT.

---

The difference is, I have [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as the main database that I use for my GMing space.
It's easy to use, has some awesome features to make my version of worldbuilding make sense, and allows for quick data 
navigation.

*However*, that's only 1 part of what my original GM Campaign Manager set out to achieve.

The more I sat on the idea, the more I realised I could add a *SHIT TONNE* of worldbuilding automation.

AND AND AND, there's the idea of a fantasy medieval economy, inspired by the supplement [Grain Into Gold](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/13113/Grain-Into-Gold).
I spent an **ungodly** amount of time converting a lot of the material into Obsidian notes, and I can use the data I've gathered to create a piece of software to...

Be my Worldbuilding Assistant.

NPC Generation, Town Generation, Income, and SO MUCH MORE. ITEM GENERATION. BOOK GENERATION. I WILL NEVER HAVE AN EMPTY LIBRARY IN A TOWER EVER AGAIN.

*pants*

*breathes*

*exhales*

With Obsidian doing all my heavy lifting, I can focus *entirely* on worldbuilding automation and economy.

So, I plan to work on that when i have time ^_^
