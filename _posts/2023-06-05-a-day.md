Spent today working on my blog again, just adding in a new resume page and checking out a few features.

I kinda want to find a personal project to work on. I've got an Anatomy exam coming up, could I create a piece of software to help with that?
Like, I already use Anki for my flashcards. I have Obsidian for my content. I just need to study for the next week.

So, how could I use my scripting skills to streamline the learning process?
Would I just use it for retrieval?
Is that all I can do?
I can't think of a way to use it to aid in my note taking...

How about something less pressing?

What are some things I *want* to work on? Somethings that interest me?

Creating this blog was an excellent start, is there anything else that I could do regarding me corner of the internet?

Hmm...

Maybe I can do some research.

I want to look into understanding Autism more, so I think I might work on that.

Yeah.

I myself have it, and some people close to me are in the same boat. So, it probably wouldn't hurt to kinda,
'deep dive' into it.

Maybe I could write a post about what I find.

HMMM. Could be fun.
