OK SO

I know that I said that I'd be working on the Worldbuilding Assistant.

And I will/have been.

HOWEVER

My partner has been working on this game called "Hailey's Aesop".

It's a text-based interactive narrative about a person trying to figure out their sexuality. It's a really fun, really engaging piecce of media that I co-authored!

So, yeah! That's what I've been up to recently, just helping her out with writing some scenes, endings, and just being a wall she can throw ideas at and maybe something useful will bounce back.

It's been really cool working with her, and maybe whoever is reading this will get a kick out of it too.
